     * ðŸ§  What it means:
     * 
     * You have a UK plug and an Indian socket. They don't match. So you use an adapter to connect them.
     * 
     * ðŸ’¼ Real-life analogy:
     * 
     * You have an old payment system that outputs XML, but your new app understands JSON. You create an adapter to convert between them.
